%description 
Darcs is a revision control system, along the lines of CVS
or arch. That means that it keeps track of various revisions
and branches of your project, allows for changes to
propogate from one branch to another. Darcs is intended to
be an ``advanced'' revision control system. Darcs has two
particularly distinctive features which differ from other
revision control systems: 1) each copy of the source is a
fully functional branch, and 2) underlying darcs is a
consistent and powerful theory of patches.

# --without-curses is needed because in External.hs they try to include term.h
# and that fails on a definition of bool (since term.h doesn't include curses.h
# to get the definition of bool).
# The above would be true if --without-curses actually did anything, but it
# seems like it doesn't.
