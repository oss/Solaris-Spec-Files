%description
Derived from the various programs distributed in the cdrtools suite, cdrkit aims to maintain interface 
compatibility with those tools. The cdrecord program has been renamed to wodim ("write optical disk media") 
so that users will not confuse it with the original cdrecord, which is still maintained by its author, 
JÃ¶rg Schilling. wodim, and the other programs distributed with cdrkit, will retain a user interfae 
compatible with the corresponding programs from the cdrtools 2.01.01a08 release, at least for the near 
future. Thus, front-end programs, such as GUI-based CD writer applications, should be able to use cdrkit 
merely by substituting the name "wodim" for the name "cdrecord".
